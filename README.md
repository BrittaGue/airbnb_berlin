# Airbnb Berlin Data

Analysis of Airbnb data from Berlin

### Data

The data used in this project was sourced from the Inside Airbnb website. I will analyze two sets of data, one called 'listings' which has information about the available Airbnb rentals in Berlin, their respective neighbourhoods and roomtypes as well as their price per night and another dataset called 'reviews_summary' which contains every available review/comment for each of the rental spaces.


The data can be downloaded here: https://www.kaggle.com/brittabettendorf/berlin-airbnb-data

(listings.csv and reviews_summary.csv)

### Objectives

1. Find out which neighbourhood is (on average) the most expensive in Berlin (listings dataset)
2. Find the adjectives that are being used the most in the comments - do visitors describe their experience positively or negatively? (reviews_summary dataset)
3. Find the neighbourhood with the highest ‚greatness-score‘ (comments containing the word ‚great‘ divided by the sum of comments - for each neighbourhood, listings & reviews_summary dataset)
